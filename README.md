# JsGame
JsGame is a framework for developing games in your browser. It uses regular JavaScript with no external libraries or APIs needed, and functions at high performance. It includes both 2D and 3D games, which can be mixed or separated at will. Here's an example:
```
var game = new Game(500, 500);
game.drawQuad(50, 50, 1.25, 150, 50, 1.25, 150, 50, 1, 50, 50, 1, 50, 150, 1.25, 150, 150, 1.25, 150, 150, 1, 50, 150, 1, "#f00");
```
This is a very simple script that draws a red cube onto the screen.  
Of course, the constructor takes very many arguments, but all are necessary in order to draw a cube onto the screen.  
*NOTE: JsGame is in Beta. Like i literally just created it beta. So dont expect much but remember theres more to come*
